## Introduction

BulkerCo is a desktop application targeted as cargo and ballast simulator for bulk carrier ships. Users can experience virtual operation of ballast console similar to one onboard. Cargo loading/discharging operations will run simultaneously during ballast operations to simulate ship at a port terminal. Users must monitor changes to ship condition and ballast plan must be followed competently. A progress report will be shown at the end of simulation corresponding to the effectiveness of ballast plan, pump efficiency, shipâ€™s strength throughout the operation and many more. 

## Get Started
This ReadMe is directed towards those interested in contributing to/acquiring the project. A quick overview about where BulkerCo is at in its development. Estimated app development is at 60%.

## Development
The user interface in BulkerCo app currently leverages ElectronJS with possible porting to Rust Webview in the future. 
##### Frontend
* Javascipt ES6
* CSS
##### Backend
* NodeJS for communication with frontend and Rust
* Rust for multithreading and intensive calculations

## Vision 
BulkerCo aims to be an all-around ship simulator and to be a close-to-reality virtual ballast operation so officers/mates can appropriately refine their skills and use them onboard.
